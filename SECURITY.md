## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you've found or become aware of a vulnerability in this project, please report the issue with as much detail and supporting evidence as possible to <security@luciddan.com>.

When you report a security issue, we will typically be in touch within 24 to 48 hours, and from there we will investigate, and if we determine that there is a security vulnerability to address, we'll release an advisory.
In most cases as we proceed we will keep you updated with the progress of the case as well.
